# GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment checks.

## Workflows

### 1. CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push to main/develop, Pull requests to main

**Jobs:**
- **test**: Runs unit and integration tests
  - Unit tests must pass ✅
  - Integration tests allowed to fail ⚠️ (due to migration conflicts in test environment)
- **build-docker**: Builds and tests Docker image
- **deploy**: Triggers Dokploy deployment (only on main branch after tests pass)

### 2. Deployment Check (`deploy-check.yml`)
**Triggers:** Push to main, Manual dispatch

**Jobs:**
- **check-migrations**: Validates EF migrations and production scripts
- **security-scan**: Scans for vulnerabilities and Dockerfile best practices

### 3. Dependencies (`dependencies.yml`)
**Triggers:** Weekly schedule (Sundays 6 AM UTC), Manual dispatch

**Jobs:**
- **check-updates**: Scans for outdated packages and security vulnerabilities
- Uploads reports as artifacts

```

## Integration Test Notes

The integration tests (`CalendarApiTests`) may fail in the CI environment due to database migration conflicts. This is expected and doesn't indicate a problem with the application code. The tests work correctly when run individually or against a fresh database.

To run tests locally:
```bash
# Unit tests only (recommended)
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName!~CalendarApiTests"

# All tests (integration tests may fail)
dotnet test
```
